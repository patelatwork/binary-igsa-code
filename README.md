Improved Gravitational Search Algorithm for Feature Selection
Overview
This project implements an advanced feature selection technique using an improved gravitational search algorithm (GSA). The algorithm optimizes feature subset selection to enhance machine learning model performance by identifying the most relevant features.
Key Features

Advanced metaheuristic optimization technique
Intelligent feature selection mechanism
Adaptable to various machine learning datasets
Randomized search with gravitational-inspired exploration
